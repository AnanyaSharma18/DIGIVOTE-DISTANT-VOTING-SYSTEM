# Blockchain Voting Platform

## Overview
The Blockchain Voting Platform is a decentralized application designed to facilitate secure, transparent, and accountable remote voting. Utilizing blockchain technology, this platform ensures that votes are immutable, verifiable, and securely recorded.

## Features
- **Voter Registration and Authentication**: Secure mechanisms for voter registration and authentication, preventing duplicate registrations and ensuring privacy.
- **Vote Casting**: Secure vote casting with anonymization and tamper-proof mechanisms.
- **Vote Verification and Tallying**: Real-time vote verification and secure tallying processes that protect voter anonymity.
- **Election Management**: Tools for election administrators to create and manage elections, including candidate lists and timelines.
